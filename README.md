## root

1. `tjm165 - Final Report - Jupyter Notebook` The pdf version of my final Jupyter Notebook report. Please note that the `.ipynb` version is in the `/code` folder so that the code runs properly
1. `Learning a Bayesian Network with Evolutionary Programming` The presentation slides that I gave during class

## root/code

1. `tjm165 - Final Report.ipynb` The Jupyter Notebook version of the final report. This is the same as the pdf version at the root directory.
1. `diabetes.csv` The Diabetes dataset that I used in some of my experiments in the final report.
1. `mdl_scorer.py` an class that takes in a dataset and then can evaluate a network on the dataset to produce an MDL score.
1. `network.py` my implementation of a network. This can also perform mutations to produce an offspring
1. `ep.py` The evolutionary programming algorithm
1. `aep.py` The adaptive evolutionary programming algorithm
1. `algo_tools.py` a few functions that are shared between `ep.py` and `aep.py`
